# Discord-Chat-Bot

At first you are required to get the token from discord developer portal and then add the bot to your server.
Then replace the token with the correct place in the code and also choose your channel for it to access.
Runt the python file and your bot should be ready to go.

Here we have used discord api and a random joke api.
